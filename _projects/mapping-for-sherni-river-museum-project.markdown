Summary for Top of Page:
Since 2023, Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) and Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific (AP Hub) collaborated with local communities on a pilot to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) to develop an open-source database of the Sherni River Basin, in Rajasthan, India. The River Museum will be accessible globally and will share information on the local rivers; and the goal was to eventually scale it to include other rivers across the country, as part of the [River Mapping for River Museum](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/River_Mapping_For_River_Museum) project.

With data collection points becoming scarcer, we must remain vigilant to protect these ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. This image of a child playing in a dried-up riverbed highlights the urgent need for sustainable water management.</figcaption>

# Background/ Problem Statement
Rivers are important ecosystems that contribute to our economic development, food security, and well-being; with nearly 2 billion people relying on rivers for their drinking water ([UNEP, 2022](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/four-reasons-protect-rivers)). In India, many communities continue to rely on rivers for direct consumption. However, rivers in India face high levels of pollution and have been found to be one of the world’s most polluted bodies of water ([Harry Blair, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772655X23000265)).
Today, many communities across India have lost interest in their rivers, taking for granted its benefits. One contributing factor, TBS asserts, is a lack of data on the rivers. Desk research on rivers across India only brings up superficial information on national and state-level rivers and insufficient information on smaller water bodies. Without information to illuminate the challenges faced by these rivers, and their ongoing deterioration, communities are less inclined to actively participate in its conservation.
Moreover, rivers are complex ecosystems that are intricately interconnected with communities across India. It is important to capture a longitudinal study of the rivers, i.e. collect and analyse the data over long periods of time. Unfortunately, data collection and analysis of these rivers today is fragmented and limited. While communities are best placed to contribute to and maintain the database, they lack the necessary skills to support this.
# Approach
Without representation on maps, these “invisible” rivers and their communities will be unable to garner support from the region and India to aid their conservation efforts. AP Hub and TBS co-designed and implemented the following workflow:
1 Remote Mapping & Validation Remote mapping and validation campaigns were launched on Humanitarian OpenStreet Map (HOT)’s Tasking Manager (TM) to map the areas of interest. This will serve as a foundation to evaluate existing needs, gaps, and challenges with local stakeholders.
2 Co-creation Planning with TBS AP Hub held co-creation planning exercises with TBS to better understand the state of map data in the region, the vision TBS has for the River Museum, the data TBS is interested to capture; and co-created a localised plan for open-mapping.
3 Field Mapping with TBS AP Hub’s network of local OM Gurus are reliable OSM experts that were trained in open-mapping; and were key facilitators of the Nepal Project on the ground. This project gave exposure to local stakeholder on how they can work with the Gurus to develop local open-mapping initiatives.
4 Use Case Discussion and Handover Workshop AP Hub held a workshop to discuss possible use cases of the OSM data and the River Museum with TBS. The updated OSM data and the River Museum was also symbolically handed over to the local stakeholders.

# Outcome and Impact
The pilot project focused on improving existing data of local water bodies and settlements in the region. Through the project, the region has seen an increase of 419% increase in water bodies OSM data and 574500% increase in buildings OSM data, through the mapping and validation efforts led by AP Hub (see fig. below).
