title: 'Call for Case Studies: Demonstrating the Impact of Open Community Mapping
  in Urban Climate Action'
date: 2024-12-10 06:23:00 Z
Summary Text: HOT and its allies in the mapping and climate science community are
  working to establish open community mapping as a key strategy in addressing urban
  climate challenges. The initiative aims to publish research in leading scientific
  journals and influence the IPCC’s upcoming report. To bolster this initiative, HOT
  invites case studies showcasing the application of open community mapping in urban
  climate and development action. These submissions will be instrumental in advancing
  the global recognition of open mapping.

Tl;Dr
By publishing research papers in leading scientific journals we intend to influence the IPCC's upcoming special report on Climate Change and Cities, advocating for the inclusion of open mapping as a key strategy. Case studies that demonstrate the application of open community mapping and data in powering urban climate and development action will be an essential part of this.

**Advancing open community mapping for urban climate action through scientific evidence and policy influence**

HOT and allies in the mapping and climate science community aim to showcase the invaluable role of open community mapping in addressing urban climate challenges. By publishing research papers in leading scientific journals, we intend to influence the IPCC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) upcoming special report on Climate Change and Cities, advocating for the inclusion of open mapping as a key strategy.

The core team on this initiative includes scientists and practitioners who believe strongly that open community mapping can drive high quality and locally-led urban climate action.

There are many routes to making the case for open mapping in urban climate action. However, this approach is about influencing the scientific community, the UN, and authorities at a national and local level and the IPCC’s next special report which is on Climate Change and Cities through academic publishing.

We have come together to create evidence / arguments that will support advocacy to this effect!

The first objective is to collaboratively write and publish a paper in response to a call from the journal npj Urban Sustainability for a collection on Climate Change and Cities.

We intend to create evidence that will then be referenced and used in the drafting of the IPCC’s next special report, which also has a focus on Climate Change and Cities.

**Call for case studies **

We urge you to share your experiences and case studies that demonstrate the impact of open community mapping in urban climate action. Your contributions will strengthen our research and amplify the voice of the open mapping community on a global stage.

Case studies that demonstrate the direct or transferable application of open community mapping and data in powering urban climate and development action are essential. Successful case study contributors will be invited as authors on the submitted paper. All submitted case studies will be made available for anyone to explore via a database.
A longer term plan is to build out these case studies into an online resource.
