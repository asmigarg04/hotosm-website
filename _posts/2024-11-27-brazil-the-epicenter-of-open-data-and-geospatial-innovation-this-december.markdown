# **Why the excitement?**

This December, Brazil takes center stage as the global geospatial and open data communities converge for an unprecedented week of events. From December 2–8, three major conferences will transform Brazil into a hub of innovation and collaboration: Open America in Brasília, FOSS4G Belém 2024, and State of the Map LATAM 2024 in Belém, Pará.

These events are more than just conferences; they’re a platform for groundbreaking discussions, knowledge sharing, and hands-on learning about the transformative power of open data and geospatial technologies.

At the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we’re passionate about [open-source tools](https://www.hotosm.org/tech-suite) and geospatial innovation that bridge critical gaps in humanitarian and development efforts. This year, we’re thrilled to not only showcase our latest advancements but also engage directly with the community—YOU!

Whether it’s at workshops, talks, or collaborative mapping sessions, these events are the perfect setting for our team to connect with the global and regional open data and geospatial communities, exchange ideas, and build partnerships. Join us as we explore how open data can address challenges like disaster response, urban planning, and community development while driving positive change and global collaboration.
