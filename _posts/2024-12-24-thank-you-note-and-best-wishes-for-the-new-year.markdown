Dear HOT Community and Partners,

As we bring this incredible year to a close, we want to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable achievements weâ€™ve accomplished together. From creating life-saving map data in underserved communities to championing local leadership and advancing innovative technologies, bringing our communities together through our campaigns, your dedication and support have always been the cornerstone of our shared success. 

Our entire team is grateful for all the incredible support received from you all. Each of your contributions, as a mapper, community leader, partner, donor, and in every small way has helped us move closer to our vision of a more equitable and resilient future. 

As we look ahead to 2025, we are excited to continue building on this momentum, deepening our collaborations, and reaching greater milestones together. We want to thank you for your continued commitment and effort.

Wishing you a joyful holiday season and a new year filled with hope for a better world! 



With gratitude,

Fabrizio Scrollini and Liz Chamberlain,

Co-Executive Directors, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team
