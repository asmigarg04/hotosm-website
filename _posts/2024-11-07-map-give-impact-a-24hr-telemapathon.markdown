→ **Q10: What’s the expected impact of the Telemapathon?**

The map data created during the Telemapathon will directly support local communities, governments, and humanitarian organizations like the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). With this information, they can respond faster and more effectively to emergencies like floods, earthquakes, and health crises, or use it to plan and prepare before disaster strikes. [Check out examples from previous projects to see how the data is used.](https://mapswipe.org/en/data/)
