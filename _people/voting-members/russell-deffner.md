<p>I was introduced to Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) at the State of the Map 2011 event and began actively contributing in 2012, primarily through the tasking manager. Over the years, I have been deeply involved in various aspects of HOT's initiatives and projects. In 2013, I played a key role in writing the Code of Conduct and participated in several Working Groups, contributing to fostering a positive and inclusive community within HOT. Later in 2013, I was honoured to be selected as the Junior Coordinator for the Mapping Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia project. As part of this project, I spent four weeks in the field, providing training and actively participating in the mapping efforts.

In recognition of my dedication and contributions, at the beginning of 2014, I was nominated to become a member of HOT and was subsequently elected as the Chairperson for the Voting Members, taking on a leadership role within the organization. In 2015, I was re-elected for a second term as Chairperson, further solidifying my commitment to the HOT community. Additionally, I was selected as the Activation Curriculum Specialist, where I utilized my expertise to develop and enhance HOT's activation (disaster mapping) procedures and guidelines.

In late 2016, I was appointed as the Project Manager for the Eliminate Malaria Mapping Campaign. This project marked a significant milestone for HOT, covering a vast geographic area of 560,000 square kilometres across seven countries. Through this campaign, we digitized every building in the specified region, aiding in the fight against malaria. Following the successful completion of the malaria campaign, I took on the role of Project Manager for the Facebook AI-Assisted Road Mapping project. I was involved in this initiative from 2017 to 2020, and we leveraged artificial intelligence to complete the road network in several countries, including Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and select areas in Haiti.

Throughout my tenure with HOT, I also actively served as the Disaster Mapping Coordinator both as a volunteer and staff member. In this capacity, I led and participated in various teams to ensure the efficient flow of geospatial information from the crowd to first responders and aid agencies during times of crisis.
In 2018, fate smiled upon me at the State of the Map - Milan conference when I met my future wife. In 2019, we got married and started a family, welcoming our son into the world.

In the same year, during the response to Cyclone Idai, the Humanitarian To Humanitarian (H2H) Network was launched. This significant event marked the first time we received funding for incident response since the establishment of our modern definition of Disaster Mapping. Subsequently, in 2020, we secured a long-term commitment from H2H for COVID mapping, which allowed us to scale up our program. With additional support from the Audacious Project, we were able to expand and recruit regional disaster associates in our hub-offices to strengthen our capabilities further.

From 2020-2023, the focus of my work shifted from global disaster mapping towards building capacity in local communities to respond to their own disasters. Although this eventually led to the conclusion of my role as global disaster response coordinator, I could not be prouder to see many local communities, with the support of the Disaster Managers in the regional hubs, standing up their own teams and responding on their own.

Overall, my journey with HOT has been incredibly fulfilling, and I am happy to continue supporting the mission as a volunteer and voting member.</p>
